# Pinnochio (P_) - P no q

**The coding agent that nobody is talking about.**

## What is this?

A competitor to Claude Code / Cursor / Aider but only uses gemma4 small models.

## Demo

❯ build me a REST API with auth

✦ Planning…

◆ Before I start, a few questions:
  1. Are you using JWT or session-based auth?
  2. Which database — Postgres, SQLite, or Mongo?
  3. Do you need rate limiting on the endpoints?

❯ JWT, postgres, yes

◆ Got it. Here's the plan:
  1. Scaffold Express routes with JWT middleware
  2. Set up Prisma with Postgres connection
  3. Add rate-limit middleware on all /api routes

  Starting now...

  Ready to execute. Proceed? [y/n]

## Install

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanieldoe/p_/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual install

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Ollama](https://ollama.ai).

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/sanieldoe/p_.git
cd p_

# Install deps
bun install

# Pull the model
ollama pull gemma4

# Run
bun run start

# Or install globally
bun link
p_
```

## Requirements

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Bun](https://bun.sh) | Runtime & package manager |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) | Local LLM inference |
| `gemma4` | The model that powers the "thinking" |

## Features

### 🎭 Excellent Tool Calls
Renders `⏺ Read("file")` / `⎿ result` tool invocations that is identical to real coding agents. Reads. Edits. Tests. Nothing.

### 📐 Plan Mode
Tasks trigger a planning flow: clarifying questions → implementation plan → approval → then execution. Every step is powered by the LLM that it's convincing.

### 👃 Growing Nose
Every "completed" task adds a `▀` block to Pinocchio's nose in the header. Use `/nose` to see the damage.

### 💬 Chat Mode
Questions get natural conversational responses. No fake tool calls, no plans — just chat.

### ⌨️  Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/status` | Session stats |
| `/history` | List "completed" tasks |
| `/nose` | Inspect the nose (triggers refresh) |
| `/exit` | Exit P_ |

Type `/` to bring up the interactive command picker with arrow-key navigation.

### 🎨 Sunset Theme
Warm gradient colors across the mascot, accent UI elements in amber/gold, cream text on dark backgrounds.

## How It Works

```
User input
    │
    ├─ starts with "/"  →  Slash command (system response)
    ├─ easter egg?      →  Dramatic pause + canned response
    ├─ task-driven?     →  Plan mode → Questions → Approval → Fake work → "Done ✓"
    └─ question?        →  Chat mode (LLM response, no faking)
```

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- **UI**: [React](https://react.dev) + [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) (terminal React renderer)
- **LLM**: [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with `gemma4`
- **Language**: TypeScript
